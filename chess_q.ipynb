    "# A Chess Question\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program which will answer a simple question – given a board state that the user enters, with 1 white figure and up to 16 black figures, which black figures can the white figure take?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program first asks the user to input a chess piece and where it is on the board. This will be the white piece. The user should be informed that they can choose between two pieces of your choice (e.g. pawn and rook). The choice should be made by writing the piece and the coordinates in a predefined format in the console, e.g.: knight a5\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the user successfully adds the white piece, the user is asked to enter the black pieces, one by one, in the same format as the white piece. They need to add at least 1 black piece or 16 at most. Once at least one black piece has been added, the user can write “done” instead of the coordinates to add no more pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can assume that the user will input either “done” or the correct format for adding a piece (“piece coordinates”). You can also assume that coordinates will always be entered as where letters are a-h and digits are 1-8, e.g. a1, d4, h8. You should not assume anything else about the inputs, however (hint: there are still at least a couple of ways for the user to make invalid input, e.g. trying to write “done” too early)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After adding each piece, there should be either a confirmation that it was added successfully, or an error message explaining what the issue is.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After the white and the black pieces are added, the program should print out the black pieces, if any, that the white piece can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll try to sketch the initial program logic, and then map it as functions in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the program should accept a user input (white piece) and place it on the board. This updates the `board_state`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secondly, the program accepts user inputs (up to 16, black pieces). \n",
    "    - Each input is then checked against the `board_state` to validate that the cell is free; if not, re-prompt the user, indicating the error\n",
    "    - If the cell is free, piece is placed there, updating `board_state` and printing confirmation\n",
    "    - The `count`, used for looping, is increased by one\n",
    "    - Once the user either a) adds 16 pieces or b) inputs `done`, the function stops\n",
    "    - Final `board_state` is returned for evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thirdly, program evaluates the possible moves (which black pieces can white piece take); for this, we'll work with pawn and rook, ignoring _en passant_ and castling options as they come from game dynamics and in our case it is impossible to tell, if, e.g., opponent's pawn has made an initial two-step move and _e.p._ is available. \n",
    "    - A function for pawn:\n",
    "    > When there is an enemy piece one square diagonally ahead of a pawn, then the pawn may capture that piece \n",
    "    - A function for rook:\n",
    "    > The rook may move any number of squares vertically or horizontally without jumping\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. In `main()`, according to the user input for white pice, the either function is run, accordingly. The function prints the sequence of black pieces that can be taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial pseudocode looks like this:"

    "As of now, we already have the board state that places white piece and 1-16 black pieces. The code also checks that the `done` is not entered until the first black piece is placed, and terminates if all 16 pieces are added. Now, we proceed with determining the logic of which black figures can the white piece take. One caveat we can spot initially is that while returning these pieces, we might not have access to its initial form (e.g. `knight a5`) as we operate with indexed lists in evaluation. We might need another function to reverse-engineer these original inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pawn will take pieces that are diagonally in front of them in one square distance. That means it will take the figures that are in `[y_coordinate - 1][x_coordinate -1]` (one row up, one square left) or `[y_coordinate - 1][x_coordinate +1]` (one row up, one square right). Pretty straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rook will take pieces in any direction of its column or row. For this, it is best to use `for` loop in row and column. The thing to notice here is that only the first encountered black piece is to be taken, as subsequent ones can only reached by jumping (not allowed for rook).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this we'll have to also take into account `IndexError`, but if we iterate with loop, this might not be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we could also reflect on the `main()` function elements that'll be needed for checking. The variables we'll use:\n",
    "    1. adjusted_w, which positions white piece in the following format list [piece, x-axis index, y-axis index]\n",
    "    2. board_state, in which we'll look for black piece placement, given the 1.) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, so far we do not have acces to variable that would allow us to reverse engineer black input figures, assuming that index is inssuficient output and we expect e.g. 'knight d3', as the piece was input. Maybe we could also append input of black pieces as dictionary and use the inverted `converter()` function before printing an answer? For now, let's leave this question open."
